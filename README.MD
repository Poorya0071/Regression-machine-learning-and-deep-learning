# Machine Learning Vs. Deep Learning for Regression Tasks.

In this repository, we are going to compare the regression problems for several datasets and apply machine learning and deep learning to them to find which models work better.

## Project 1: Car MPG

The purpose of this project is to predict the MPG of a car using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The goal is to compare the results of the two approaches and determine which method is more effective for this specific task.

MPG stands for miles per gallon and it refers to a common measurement of fuel economy - the average number of miles a vehicle can drive on one gallon of fuel. The higher the MPG, the more economically friendly a car is.

### Results: 

After predicting by Random Forest and DNN, the accuracy of **Random Forest** is around **88%**, and **DNN** is **92%**. Then we can conclude that deep learning works better in this dataset.

## Project 2: House Price in Boston

This project aims to predict house prices in Boston using machine learning and deep learning models.

### Results: 
The results are available in the data frame in the notebook file. Looking at the data frame for the results, we can conclude that the deep learning DNN model on the scaled dataset has the best performance.

## Project 3: Insurance Dataset

In this project, we will solve the regression problem, predict the charge value once with RandomForrest Regressor and once with Deep Neural Network, and compare the results.

### Results

By comparing these two models,RandomForrest Regressor and DNN, we can conclude that, in most cases, the DNN model works highly better.

## Project 4: Car Price Prediction

This project aims to predict the price of a car with two different methods, the classic machine learning method with Sklearn and the Deep neural network with TensorFlow.

### Results

In the car price project, we implement two machine learning models, Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor, and a Deep Learning model, the DNN model. After creating the data frame for the prediction results on the test data set, we conclude that the Random Forest has the best performance among Machine Learning models. Overall, the deep learning model, DNN, has the highest accuracy.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, deep learning models generally perform better than machine learning models for regression tasks. However, depending on the type of data, the results may change.
